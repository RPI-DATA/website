## Project 1 Work Session

### Class Objective:

The goal of this class is to dive into a couple Kaggle projects in detail, discussing different approaches and understanding the problem, approach, and solution in detail.

### Assignment (To be done before class):
(1) (10 points, Due 10-16) Prepare a 3 minute powerpoint presentation that details a specific solution.  It should be just 1 slide on the problem and one slide on the solution (should include a link).
Solutions should be ones that generate solutions to the prediction challenge. They shouldn't just be exploratory analysis.

### In Class Activities
We are going to fill [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DQddDfxnpAsbr_EU5GE4iLAoNQzC2BkzH4eiAtVNZg4/edit?usp=sharing) in. Use the filename for your presentation found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wtabky6wzvfddj0/AAAwf7rzVQGu3S7g1df6Ydala?dl=0).

Then we will here we will sort by project and go down the different project and solutions.
