### Course Overview & Introduction to the Data Science Lifecycle

#### Class Objective:
This class is to discuss the broader issues of data analytics, the approach of the class, and the technologies to be utilized.  We will also show you how to work in Jupyter Notebooks and with Git/Github.

#### Readings (To be done before class):
- Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com). We will be using GitHub Classroom for collecting assignments (this is new so there may be bumps).
- Create a [Slack account](https://join.slack.com/t/tf-f17/shared_invite/MjMwNzcwMTg1MzE5LTE1MDMzNTE2NzMtZWVhOGYxNWFmYQ) for the classroom Slack channel. We will use this for the majority of communications.
- Fill out [this survey](https://jasonkuruzovich.typeform.com/to/O8ZFWj).
- Install Git, Github Desktop, and Anaconda (with Python 3.6). More detailed configuration instructions will be provided Monday but if you can get started with these that would be great.
- Additional Suggested Reading: [Chapter 1 from Doing Data Science](http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.libproxy.rpi.edu/book/databases/9781449363871) and [Chapter 1 from Data Science for Business] (http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.libproxy.rpi.edu/book/databases/business-intelligence/9781449374273) (Both available through library).

#### In Class Activities:
- [Presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tqqhi0bglzggdl8/01-introduction.pptx?dl=0).
