Hi all,

In class I mentioned having a shorter modeling homework this week due next Thursday. Because of the delay in posting it, I'm going to cancel and will just have a slightly longer assignment next week. Consider it a Fall homework break!

The Tableau assignment is still due tonight.

Here are some cool readings/videos.
