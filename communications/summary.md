Hi All.

Homework 7 has been posted.  Sorry for the delay.

I am hopeful it isn't too difficult and will provide a good foundation for Project 2.

Because of the holiday weekend, I've adjusted the due date to be 11-28. Try to get started with the HM so you can ask questions in class this week.

I've also updated the [readings for next week](http://rpi.analyticsdojo.com/mgmt6560-fa17/schedule/class11/) and links to presentations for past two weeks. If I don't get the link posted before class, you can always follow the [dropbox share on bottom left of the main home page](http://rpi.analyticsdojo.com).

As I discussed in class, [Project 2 is posted](http://rpi.analyticsdojo.com/mgmt6560-fa17/project2/). Would be good to get started on it over the break.

Jason
