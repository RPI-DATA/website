Hello All:

Lots to cover tonight.  Please git here early. ;) Coding joke.

Course Website<br>
The [course website](http://rpi.analyticsdojo.com) is live, and I've been putting a lot of work into putting it together, but it is very much still a work in progress.

Tonight we will be test driving a [JupyterHub ](http://lab.analyticsdojo.com) environment that should make it easier to get up do speed with coding.

**When you log in your should log in with your github username** Eventually we will go to GitHub authentication and you will have to start over with your environment if you don't use your GitHub username.
