@channel Thank you for everyone who has jumped into help when I was away. I survived 4 days in the woods with 200 5th graders and was able to help some folks remotely (but not always in a timely manner). As I wasnâ€™t available for office hours Thursday, I'm glad to have a google hangout session with anyone tomorrow between 10-2. Please feel free to direct message me via slack.

Also, I spent some time responding to people in the HM channel on Slack today. If you had posted a question, please check.

I'd suggest installing the slack app on your phone and desktop so you will get notifications. I think you will like it if you make the switch.
