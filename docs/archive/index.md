## Lab-Homework Submission Instructions
These are instructions for completing the first lab. We will be using [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) to distribute and collect all assignments.  This is new for this semester so expect some bumps.

The advantage to this is that you will be learning to work with real tools while submitting assignments.

#### Step 1: Accept the Assignment
- By clicking `Accept the Assignment` on the link in the class website GitHub will automatically create a starter private repository for you. It might take a few minutes.

#### Step 2: Clone the private repository
- Clone the repository using whatever development environment you are using. You should be able to see the repository URL on [github.com](github.com).

#### Step 3: Commit your changes to the repository.
- Add and commit your changes using the command line or GitHub Desktop.  Push your changes (sync/publish on the Desktop) to the GitHub repository.

#### Step 4: Verify your code.
- At the time the homework is due the final code in the repository will be tagged as the submissions and future commits won't be evaluated.  View your repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) and make sure that all of your commits have been pushed.

### Assignment (due Wednesday following next class by 11:59 PM):
#### Getting Started with Tableau Desktop.
For this lab we will begin the process of learning visualization through the [See Click Fix Kaggle Project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/see-click-predict-fix).  Go ahead and download the train file from [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theusual/kaggle-seeclickfix-ensemble/master/Bryan/Data/train.csv).

The first part of any data visualization project is data understanding. Start with the process of understanding the data fields and the context of the data.  

(1). IN YOUR OWN WORDS, describe what the data involves and key fields that are identified.

*Import the Data.*  You should be able to do this using the instructions from class and the video.
We want to get started with identifying the data on a map.  Drag the Longitude to the column and the Latitude to the rows.

*Filter the Data.*  We have 4 cities here but we only want one of them.  We need to create a filter that selects based on the longitude/latitude to only show one city.   

(2). IN YOUR OWN WORDS, describe the filter you created to select only one city.

*Change the type to a Map.*  Select on the *Show Me* map to show your city on a map.  (This actually happens automatically).

*Tag Type.* Drag the tags over to the colors and select filter and add.  Select just a few tags.  

*Understand Tags*.  Create a new worksheet and drag Tag Type from the dimensions and create a visualization that is sorted by the count of the number of tags.  

(3). Provide an image showing the 5 most frequent tag types.

(4).  Create 3 visualizations that help you to understand more details about the data or make a specific point.  At least one should use the Map.  Provide 1-3 sentences to describe each visualization.  

Here are some [examples](https://gist.github.com/jkuruzovich/a3b49f5004ad1e466ae5ddc97662d3e6).

#### The following should be conducted with R.
For this part of the assignment, use the embeded mpg dataset.  For this, your can create the dataframe with the code:
`mpg<-mpg`

(5) Create histograms for the `cty` and `hwy` variables.  Do the distribibutions appear to be normally distributed?

(6) Create a scatter plot mapping `disp` vs `hwy` and `cyl` vs `hwy`.  Based on the graph, which seems to be the stronger relationship to `hwy`, `disp` (displacement) or `cyl` (# cylinders).

#### The following should be conducted with Python using your project dataset (if possible, otherwise choose something interesting).  

(7) Create (a) histograms of two different variables. Describe what type of distribution(s) the data appears to follow.

(8) Create two scatterplots that maps variables.  Does there appear to be a relationship between the variables? Why might this be?

# Class 7

### Assignment (due Wednesday following next class by 11:59 PM):

No assignment because of the midterm.

# Class 8

### Class Objective:

The goal of this is to have you summarize work to date.

### Readings (To be done before class):
No readings today. Review and prepare for midterm.

### In Class Activities:
We will start with the midterm. We will think have a check-in regarding the project. I'd like to make sure that each of you understand what your *baseline* model is for comparison.  This should be a simple model in which the modeling process is quite simplified.  For example, in the Twitter assignment we used the *everyone dies* senario to provide a baseline for comparison.  
26-Oct (or before). Manditory 1st check-in with instructor/TA.

#### Midterm
The midterm will consist of 2 sections.

Part 1: Multiple Choice/Short answer
The first section will be closed book/closed notes.  You should understand conceptual issues with the class, technologies, packages, CRISP model, etc. If given a piece of code, you should be able to interpret what it does.  In this section, you won’t be asked to generate any code though.

Part 2: Coding
Like the homework, there will be sections where you need to write specific code responses to questions, similar to the homework.  

You are allowed to bring a 1 page (both sides) or 2 pages (1 side each) of a crib sheet with syntax.

Python Questions. (Hint: There is a detailed how-to model for the Boston Housing Dataset. If you are having trouble, copy that one and update it to the IRIS dataset and Random forrest model.)
<br>
(1) Do a Random forest for the IRIS dataset using Python.


(2) Calculate the Accuracy of the prediction using Python.  

(3) Is there any difference between the Random Forrest R result and the Python result?
