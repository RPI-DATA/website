Data literacy is a foundational component of a modern technical and scientific education. Critical to creating data literate graduates.

For the [Data 8 class](http://data8.org), the University of California at Berkley has developed an open [curriculum]() and extensive teaching infrastructure ([online textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com), [auto-grader](https://okpy.org), [Jupyter-based cloud computing infrastructure for data science](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s)) created the worlds largest data science class.

**This proposal suggests creating an instance of the Data 8 class @ Rensselaer. All materials for the Data 8 course have been released under a compatible Creative Commons license.**

This course integrates programming, statistics, and analysis in a single course using the Python programming language.

Sharing of highly developed classes from one university to another has had a positive impact in other cases. For example, CS50 @ Yale-companion course to Harvard's popular introductory CS course-was the most popular course at Yale last year.

Bringing a well developed curriculum regarding data science to campus would provide an extremely well documented platform on which to build additional bridge course, which could follow the [Connector Courses](http://data.berkeley.edu/topics/connector-courses) model but be aligned with the Unique offerings of Rensselaer.

Following the marketing of the course at Berkley, Data 8 @ Rensselaer would be cross-listed as an introductory course across a variety of disciplines, potentially including ITWS, MATH, MGMT, ISYE, and any other areas that would see value.
