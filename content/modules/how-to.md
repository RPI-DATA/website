* The "Files" tab is where all your files are kept,
* The "Running" tab keeps track of all the processes and notebooks currently live, and
* The "Clusters" tab is provided by IPython Parallel, Python's parallel computing framework. 

### Creating a New Notebook
---

To open a new notebook, you can click on the "New" in the "Files tab" and choose the kernel you would like to use.

After getting in the notebook. 

* you can add `crtl + b` or delete a new cell (either markdown or the language you choose).
* Using the `shift + tab` after the code, you can see the function of it.
* After finishing one cell, using `shift + enter` to run it
* To apply a latex in you markdown, you can add your latex between `$$` like `$$c =\pi $$`
You can use the botton at the top for some of those command, as well.
