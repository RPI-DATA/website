Welcome to the alpha version of the DATA@RENSSELAR, a platform for enabling data science across the cirriculum.

Currently the learning stack associated with these courses includes: (1) Jupyterhub (2) GitHub Classroom (3) Travis-CI Based Autograding and (4) Slack. The idea is by adopting a common tecnology stack across different classes, we will be better able to coordinate learning.
