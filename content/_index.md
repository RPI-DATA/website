Welcome to the alpha version of the DATA@RENSSELAR, a platform for enabling data science across the curriculum.

Currently the learning stack associated with these courses includes: (1) Jupyter (2) GitHub Classroom (3) Slack and (4) [coming soon] autograding. The idea is by adopting a common technology stack across different classes, we will be better able to coordinate learning.
