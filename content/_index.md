Welcome to DATA@RENSSELAR, a platform for enabling data science across the curriculum.

We are an open source project that helps analytics programs to both create a community and deliver the highest quality education experience in the rapidly changing world of analytics and data science.

Currently the learning stack associated with these courses includes:

1. Jupyter
2. GitHub Classroom
3. Slack
4. [coming soon] autograding

Our idea is by adopting a common technology stack across different classes, we will be better able to coordinate learning.
