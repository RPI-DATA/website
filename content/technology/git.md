### Git and Github
Git is a version control system use to track changes to code, and when combined with Github it is an extremely powerful way to collaborate.

(1) Install the [git command line tool](https://git-scm.com/downloads). There are a lot of options but you should be able to just utilize the defaults.

(2) Create an account on [github.com](https://github.com).

(3) Install Github desktop if using OSX or Windows. [Click here for download instructions for Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

(4) Once you are done installing Github desktop, open the program.  Sign in with your Github Credentials to link the desktop application with your Github account.


(5) Clone the [class repository](https://github.com/jkuruzovich/techfundamentals-spring2018-materials) either from the desktop tool or from the command line.

From the Github tool:

From the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/jkuruzovich/techfundamentals-spring2018-materials
```

(6) In the future when you want to update the repository, you can do so either from the command line or the GitHub Desktop tool.

From the GitHub Desktop, press the sync button after selecting the repository:
